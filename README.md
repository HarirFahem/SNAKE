### **Credit**

<a name="credit"></a>

We cannot deny that we have made a huge effort to realize this project. However, this would not have been possible without your support and help, we would like to express our sincere thanks to you.

By way of recognition, we would like to thank, very sincerely, Mr **BELCAID Anass**, for his quality supervision, his professional motivation, his advice and constructive criticism, his corrections, his kindness, and his patience as well as for the time he has dedicated to carrying out this work.

We would like to thank you again for your careful reading of this report, as well as for the comments you will make us during the defense to improve our work. 

Finally, we would like to warmly thank our training director as well as the entire teaching team of EIDIA Euromed who gave us an incredible opportunity to be able to work on this type of project, to prepare us for the professional world in general.


### **Introduction** 

<a name="INTRO"></a>

"" **You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. It's logic-based creativity.** ""

The **QGraphicsView class** provides a widget for displaying the contents of a QGraphicsScene. QGraphicsView visualizes the contents of a QGraphicsScene in a scrollable viewport. To create a scene with geometrical items, see QGraphicsScene's documentation. QGraphicsView is part of the Graphics View Framework.

The **QGraphicsScene class** provides a surface for managing a large number of 2D graphical items. The class serves as a container for QGraphicsItems. It is used together with QGraphicsView for visualizing graphical items, such as lines, rectangles, text, or even custom items, on a 2D surface. QGraphicsScene is part of the Graphics View Framework. It also provides functionality that lets you efficiently determine both the location of items, and for determining what items are visible within an arbitrary area on the scene. With the QGraphicsView widget, you can either visualize the whole scene, or zoom in and view only parts of the scene. 

The QGraphicsView class provides a widget for displaying the contents of a QGraphicsScene. It visualizes the contents of a QGraphicsScene in a scrollable viewport. To create a scene with geometrical items, see QGraphicsScene's documentation. QGraphicsView is part of the Graphics View Framework.

The **QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent class** provides mouse events in the graphics view framework. When a QGraphicsView receives a QMouseEvent, it translates it to a QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent. The event is then forwarded to the QGraphicsScene associated with the view. If the event is not handled by the scene, the view may use it, e.g., for the DragMode. In addition to containing the item, scene, and screen coordinates of the event (as pos(), scenePos(), and screenPos()), mouse events also contain the coordinates of the previous mouse event received by the view. These can be retrieved with lastPos(), lastScreenPos(), and lastScenePos().

The **QGraphicsItem class** is the base class for all graphical items in a QGraphicsScene. It provides a light-weight foundation for writing your own custom items. This includes defining the item's geometry, collision detection, its painting implementation and item interaction through its event handlers. QGraphicsItem is part of the Graphics View Framework.

The **QMediaPlayer class** allows the playing of a media source. It is a high level media playback class. It can be used to playback such content as songs, movies and internet radio. The content to playback is specified as a QMediaContent object, which can be thought of as a main or canonical URL with additional information attached. When provided with a QMediaContent playback may be able to commence.

The **QMediaPlaylist class** provides a list of media content to play. It is intended to be used with other media objects, like QMediaPlayer. It allows to access the service intrinsic playlist functionality if available, otherwise it provides the local memory playlist implementation.

The **QDebug class** provides an output stream for debugging information. It is used whenever the developer needs to write out debugging or tracing information to a device, file, string or console.

<a name="overview"></a>
This project is a very important experience for us EIDIA students to become familiar with these new materials that we can consider very important.
 	During this period, the project that we are going to carry out is an game named **Snake Game**
	To clarify things for you, and to bring you closer to the options offered by our project, we have written this report which contains all the details and explanations associated with our project.
  To achieve Snake Game, we used Qt-Creator which is a cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) built for the maximum developer experience. Qt Creator runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS desktop operating systems, and allows developers to create applications across desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms.
  In carrying out this project, we had several objectives, thanks to which we were able to frame our work, and do our research in a well-organized way.
The objectives that have been set to carry out this work are the following:

### **Conclusion**

<a name="conclusion"></a>


This project turned out to be very rewarding insofar as it consisted of a concrete approach to the engineering profession. Indeed, taking the initiative and respecting deadlines will be essential aspects of our future profession.
In addition, it allowed us to apply our knowledge to a practical area.
As well as during our work, we had a problem with our computer, it hangs completely and if we don't restart it by pushing the power button, it won't work. Despite all its difficulties, it helps us to know consistent values across the entire field studied, which we will probably be led to do in our future profession.
â€¢	To summarize, this project is a very important experience for us to be familiar with this material and to develop our skills
Thank you Sir
